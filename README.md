Stats for students (and everybody else)
---------------

A selection of resources about statistics, with a slight emphasis on R.

### Six great (text)books on statistics and (sometimes) R

- [Improving Your Statistical Inferences](https://lakens.github.io/statistical_inferences/index.html) by Daniel Lakens (free) - if you use only one thing from this website, start with this one

- [Modern Dive: An Introduction to Statistical and Data Sciences via R](https://moderndive.com) by Chester Ismay and Albert Y. Kim (free)

- [Modern Statistics for Modern Biology](https://www.huber.embl.de/msmb/) by Susan Holmes and Wolfgang Huber (free)

- [Learning Statistics with R](http://www.compcogscisydney.org/learning-statistics-with-r/) by Danielle Navarro (free)

- [Introduction to Modern Statistics](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/) by Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel and Johanna Hardin (free)

- [The Art of Statistics: Learning from Data](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0241398630/) by David Spiegelhalter

### Journals' resources on statistics

- [Nature's Statistics for Biologists](https://www.nature.com/collections/qghhqm) series (in particular their [Practical guides](https://www.nature.com/collections/qghhqm/content/practical-guides)).

- [PeerJ Collection: Practical Data Science for Stats](https://peerj.com/collections/50-practicaldatascistats/) series.

### Josh Starmer's YouTube channel

[StatQuest with Josh Starmer](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtYLUTtgS3k1Fg4y5tAhLbw) "breaks down complicated Statistics and Machine Learning methods into small, bite-sized pieces that are easy to understand".

### Daniel Lakens & Jeff Leek (et al.)

Daniel Lakens runs probably the best introductory course on statistics on the internet: [Improving your statistical inferences](https://www.coursera.org/learn/statistical-inferences) (keep an eye on his blog at [The 20% Statistician](http://daniellakens.blogspot.co.uk/) as well.

Jeff Leeks (co-)runs multiple courses online, but if I had to pick one, it would be the [Chromebook Data Science](http://jhudatascience.org/chromebookdatascience/): "a free, massive open online educational program (...) to help anyone who can read, write, and use a computer to move into data science (...)". As the name suggests, the only things you need to participate is an internet connection and a web browser.

### Great visualisations

- [Seeing Theory - a Visual Introduction to Probability and Statistics](https://seeing-theory.brown.edu)

- [Teacups, giraffes, & statistics](https://tinystats.github.io/teacups-giraffes-and-statistics/index.html) - yes, I know, but just click there (also, examples use R in-browser).

- [The Permutation Test: A Visual Explanation of Statistical Testing](https://www.jwilber.me/permutationtest/) by Jared Wilber (also with animals...)

- [Interpreting Cohen's d effect size an interactive visualization](https://rpsychologist.com/d3/cohend/) (don't miss the visualisations on correlations and power)

- [Visualizing Bayes Theorem](https://oscarbonilla.com/2009/05/visualizing-bayes-theorem/)

### P values and and the null hypothesis significance testing: the good, the bad and the ugly

- [Scientists rise up against statistical significance](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00857-9): "Valentin Amrhein, Sander Greenland, Blake McShane and more than 800 signatories call for an end to hyped claims and the dismissal of possibly crucial effects."

- [Objections to Frequentism](http://www.statisticool.com/objectionstofrequentism.htm)... are exagerrated :-)

- [Statement on p-values from the American Statistical Association](http://www.amstat.org/asa/files/pdfs/P-ValueStatement.pdf)
